Haters talked down, barnacles chomped up, but nothing could stop Chuck from making one hell of a come up!

Guaranteed to take your mind off this crazy presidential election for five minutes or so, The Return of Chuck is the sequel to the original Platformer game I use to teach students Game Design.  In this adventure, the ever-skillful Chuck has got to save his main squeeze, Boo, while deftly maneuvering pesky enemies and ridiculous obstacles.  

Damn straight, you should download it from Google Play and comment on it like it was 3 a.m. and you were Donald J. Trump sitting on a golden toilet bowl.  Here is your opportunity to do your true civic duty this year!

Of course this game (and the class) could not be possible without the generosity and ample skills of the one and only Kenney a.k.a. Asset Jesus!

Thanks to all...now go play the game and comment already...
